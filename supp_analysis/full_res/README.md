Data repository for supplementary analyses.

We provide data sets where plots and/or tables only contain a summary of data. For full methodology, see our paper's appendices.

 * res_windowedpi.zip: Contains nucleotide diversity values of sliding windows for all data sets, either as a .RData object for 28 data sets or as text tables (output from vcftools). In the paper, we reported mean and standard deviation from these values. 
 * Full DAPC and PCA results for all data sets from our population structure analysis.
 * Tables (as txt or RData objects) containing all necessary nucleotide diversities to compute the probability that the MRCA of sample/outgroup is older than the time of divergence of these groups. 

We also provide Tables A4 and A5 as a text file for convenience (same table entries as in the manuscript).
