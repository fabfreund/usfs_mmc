 * comp_phigrid.R: computes the parameter grids on which parameters are inferred (so we are searching the produced grids of parameters for the optimal parameter combination)
 * cross_model_eval_BF_gridnogrid.R: Computes the model selection errors when running our model selection approach for simulations from models with parameters both on grid and off grid  
 * cross_model_eval_BF_psi005.R: As above, just only for simulations from Psi-coalescents with low Psi values     
 * paramestimqual_ongrid.R: Assesses the errors of within-class errors (classes Beta coal, Psi coal) of grid-based parameter estimation based on on grid simulations   
 * param_set_offgrid.R: Parameter settings for off-grid simulations
 * param_set_ongrid.R: Parameter settings for on-grid simulations             
 * param_set_psi_005.R: Parameter set for additional values for Psi coalescent simulation               
 * phi_tables: Contains the expected SFS for the parameter grids (needed to compute the pseudolikelihoods on which we select models and estimate parameters)
 * pics/: designated location for plots generated by plot_error_gg2.R - just there for convenience, it does not contain any (non-empty) files
 * plot_paramest_error.R: Plots the error output from paramestimqual_ongrid.R (producing Figures 1, A.4-A.6, A.10-A.21 from the manuscript) 
 * results4plotstables/: contains the results of the simulation study. Model selection results (from cross_model_eval_BF...) are denoted by crossmodBF... (these are the basis of Tables 1, A.2 and A.3 in the manuscript). Parameter selection results within model class (Beta or Psi) are denoted by estimR2err.... A suffix of s<number> denotes the sample size simulated.   
 * simulated_snpdata/: Simulated SNP sequences on which we ran the statistical machinery to assess model selection and parameter estimation errors (for the different sample sizes, here denoted by n)
 * simul_dirac_beta_growth_onoffgrid.R, simul_dirac_psi005.R: The scripts to produce the simulations in simulated_snpdata/
